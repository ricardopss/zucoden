## CSS hexadecimal RGBA

You can write `background-color: #ff0000;` if you want something that is red.

And you can write `background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5);` if you want something red and translucent.

To represent the hexadecimal colors partially translucid, simply add the Hex prefix to the hex colour value to add an alpha that has the equivalent opacity as the % value.

(in rbga the percentage opacity is expressed as a decimal as mentioned above)

```
