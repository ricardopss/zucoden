## What is D3.js
D3 stands for _data-driven documents_ and is a class of applications. D3 was create to fill a demand for web-accessible data visualization.

Until recently, it wasn't possible to build high performance internet applications in the browser unless you built them in Flash or as a Java applet (though there are still around on the internet).

D3.js provides the same performance, but integrated into web standards and the `Document Object Model` (DOM) at the core of the HTML.

D3.js provides developers with the ability to create rich interactive and animated content based on data and tie that content to existing web page elements. 

It gives you the tools to create sofisticated data visualization, adn to dynamically update traditional web content.

D3.js should not be, although, view as a simple charting library. The process to create a chart is much longer as than using a dedicated charting libraries.

What it may be viewed as it weakness it is also its strengths: D3 allows you to build whatever data-driven graphics and interactivity one can imagine.

## How D3.js works?
Data visualization is more than data visualization (as traditional charts), geospatial and network visualizations.

Although the ability to crate rich and varied graphics is one of D3´s strong points, more important for modern web development is the ability to embed the high level of interactivity that users expect. 

With D3, every element of every chart is made interactive in the same way.

You don´t invest time learning D3 so that you can deploy Excel-style charts on the web (for that, there are easier and more convenient libraries).

You learn D3 because it gives you the ability to implement almost every major data visualization technique, and more, it also gives you the power to create your own data visualization techniques (which is something that not every general library offers).
