Sphinx is a tool that makes it easy to create intelligent and beautiful documentation, written by Georg Brandl and licensed under the BSD license.

It was originally created for the `Python` documentation, and it has excellent facilities for the documentation of software projects in a range of languages. Of course, this site is also created from {{< code gold>}}reStructuredText{{< /code >}} sources using Sphinx!
